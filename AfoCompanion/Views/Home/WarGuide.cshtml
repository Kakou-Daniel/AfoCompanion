    **This guide was made long time ago by player hawkes and I had this guide for a while so I am posting it here. It's pretty useful and well written so all credits goes to him.

    <div class="war-basics">
        <p>Okay, so, first I will give the simple basics of war strats and then I will get into how to manipulate these to your advantage. The terms wave and round will be used a lot, please do not confuse them. A round is 1 battle of 5v5, a wave is the entire guild fighting once.</p>
        <p>First off, there is weakest first, strongest first, and random…I think they are pretty self explanatory. You can adjust which strategy you will use in your guild settings menu. </p>
        <p>Rankings in a guild are really only good for 2 things, controlling bidding in the auction and determining who fights where in a war. What the ranking for war does, for simplicity sakes, it determines who your “strongest” members are. </p>
        <p>When in a war, the order goes first on ranking, and second on xp that the member has (except on random…rankings do not affect the order at all, it is completely random). Therefore, regardless of what lvl the member is, a general will always be classified as your strongest members, then colonels, then captains. Therefore, ranking becomes very important in wars in order to adjust not just the promoted members, but the rest of the team as I will get into shortly.</p>
        <p>This is particularly important to fend off invaders as it is usually them that are stronger than you, however, you will still have a very good chance as long as they are within 2 average lvl of you.</p>
        <p>First and foremost, if you want to win a war against an invader, you MUST be active during the war…set an alarm or something so that you are on 10 minutes before the war starts. This will give you enough time to check their promotions and see if their leader/admins are online at that particular point in time.</p>
        <p>Next, do your homework…as soon as you see that a guild is invading you, go to their war page and briefly view the last 10 or so wars that they had…all you are doing is checking to see if they normally go with weakest or strongest first and if they usually adjust ranks as well. This will help you develop a good counter to them. In both examples you want to maximize the amount of members you kill in the first wave. Since every time you battle, your stats fatigue by 10%, if you are able to take out most of their members first wave…then they will be left with less members to fight repeatedly and their stats will degrade with each fight, making it possible for a lvl 30 to easily take out a lvl 50. You will more than likely want to use the same war order that your invaders do and adjust your rankings to maximize damage in first wave if possible. If they normally promote many members, than you may have to get more creative.</p>
        <p>Know your member’s lvls really good…I have an excel spreadsheet with all of the players lvls of knighthawkes so I can compare with invaders. Sometimes it is necessary to get into that much detail, but not always…at least have a good idea of your top 15 guys.</p>
        <p>Lastly on the basics is focus fire. This can be a double edged sword. Sometimes I have it on…other times I don’t. If luck is on your side, it is best to not have focus fire on. You have to look at it this way. When focus fire is on, it means your members will only attack 1 player at a time…which in most cases, will ensure at least 1 guy bites the bullet unless it is an overpowered match. However, it can hurt your chances in circumstances such as the following examples:</p>
        <p>3 players in a row use stone spell…it is all on the same guy and does not stack…so 2 players attacks were wasted and their stone spell is now gone. 2 players with ice swords attack the same guy, the enemy is frozen, then unfrozen by the next attack whereas a second person could have been frozen.</p>
        <p>I haven’t figured out yet if having it on or off is really beneficial…so I just tend to experiment a little.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="war-strats">
        <p>Now that you have the basics, let’s get into how to manipulate these properly to your advantage using each type of strategy, starting with random.</p>
        <p>Random is really only a good strat if you are the same average lvl as the invading guild (or more powerful, but won’t be on for the battle) and you have about 10 VERY powerful guys in your guild. This will mix them in with weaker guys so you will be left with more guys after the first wave and your stats won’t degrade as much. These are the only 2 cases that random should be used as it doesn’t really make any waves solid…but a lot of waves pretty decent.</p>
        <p>Now for strongest first. Whenever you promote members to strongest first, you should ALWAYS promote in groups of 5. This will ensure that your 5 strongest members are always fighting together. Whenever you are trying to maximize damage in the first wave, you are trying to make sure that your guys are fighting guys 1 lvl below them. At the same time, with strongest first, sometimes, your strongest wave will be more powerful than theirs, or their second strongest wave, so taking out their big wave at the first will be beneficial to you. This is where the ranks of general, colonel and captain really become important. </p>
        <p>The first example which is the easier, would simply be this…lets say, they have 90 members, and you have 80…they go strongest first with no promotions. If you want to maximize your damage output, you could promote your bottom 15 guys to captain and use them as “meat shields” and have no ranks on any other members. This way, the first 3 rounds will be losses for you against their strongest members, however, your entire wave now is shifted down 3 rounds. Now your strongest members are fighting their 16th-20th strongest members, your 6th-10th strongest members are fighting their 21st-25th strongest members and so on. This will ensure that you take out the rest of their team easily. Now you are left with 65 members that have all fought once (except for your top 10 who have fought twice…remember, they had 10 more members than you in this example), and they are left with 15 that have all fought once. Since your top 10 guys have not fought again, their top 15 will now have to fight 3-4 more times to get back to your top 10 guys. So they have now degraded by 10% 4-5 times, while your top 10 have only gone down by 2 battles of 10%. This will give you a very big advantage to enable you to take them out.</p>
        <p>Strongest first can sometimes be more complicated than this. Lets say, you have 1 strongest wave of all lvl 50s, and theirs is all 52s, but their second strongest wave is all 49s…what you can do, is promote your bottom 5 to generals as meat shields. Then, promote your top 5 to colonels to fight their second wave and take them out. You can then promote 5 more lower members as colonels to be meat shields for the next wave. You can repeat this as well for captains if it proves beneficial for you. Again, MAXIMIZE DAMAGE OUTPUT IN THE FIRST WAVE. That is the most important thing when considering promotions.</p>
        <p>In cases where they promote members as well in strongest first, match their promotions with members 1 lvl higher than them, and then, promote some meat shields after that if you can…for example, they promote 10 captains of lvl 35…you promote 10 colonels of lvl 36 and then promote 10 captains after that as meat shields to ensure victory for the rest of the waves following.</p>
        <p>Lastly is weakest first. This differs a little as you have to look at not only the first few guys that fight, but also your last guys. When promoting in weakest first, you always want to promote enough to ensure your 5 strongest guys fight together again. For example, If you have 87 guys, you want to promote in groups of, 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, or 32. In the last example, if you were to promote 30 guys for example…your 2 strongest guys would be fighting with 3 weaker guys and will probably lose, and you don’t want to lose your strongest guys. </p>
        <p>Again you want to maximize damage output in your first wave. When you promote guys on weakest first, you will be shift your strongest guys down a round each group of 5 you promote, which means they will be stronger guys fighting weaker guys. If you have the same amount of members as your opponent, this is relative easy, however, when you are fighting a guild for 5 or more member difference, you need to take the entire team into consideration. For example. If you have 80 members, and they have 90 members, it means your 5 strongest will be fighting their 11th-15th strongest. This goes both ways as well, if you have 90 members, and they have 80, their strongest will fight your 11th-15th strongest.</p>
        <p>In the case that you have more members than them, your first step is promoting enough of your weaker members to have your 5 strongest against their 5 strongest. For example, if you have 90 members, and they have 80 members, the first step is promoting the 10 weakest members to captain.  From there, you look at what the rest of the battle will be like...a lot of the time, you will only need to promote 2-3 rounds worth of guys in order to be over them. Other times, you may have to max out your promotions in order to ensure the maximum amount of kills in the first wave.</p>
        <p>If you are unable to promote enough to win the majority of the first wave (most likely because they promote a lot) you may want to consider going to strongest first. In this case, you will go strongest first, and promote generals and colonels at are 1 lvl above who they will be fighting in their respective rounds. From there, skip your strongest 5 guys, and promote the 6th-(maximum)25th strongest guys as captains. Make sure if you do this though, you look at where your weakest captain will be fighting. You don`t want to go down promoting all 20 captains, but have 2 waves of captains lose and potentially your strongest wave lose because you promoted too many. This kind of strat is a last ditch effort to beat an invading guild that is stronger and promotes a lot.</p>

<div class="war-summary">
    <p>So, to sum everything up:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be active for the war and constantly check the invaders promotions</li>
        <li>Do your homework and see what strat they use to develop a good counter to it</li>
        <li>Maximize the amount of members killed in the first wave</li>
        <li>Always keep your strongest 5 together</li>
        <li>Remember, you can`t win them all, so if you lose a war, just work hard to get stronger for next time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>-So if a guild beats a guild that has either 1000 rep more or less than them, they'll gain 50 rep.</p>
    <p>-If a guild beats a guild with 1000-2000 LESS rethan them, they'll only gain 30 rep</p>
    <p>-If a guild beats a guild with 2000-3000 LESS rep than them, they'll only gain 10 rep</p>
    <p>-If a guild beats a guild with 3000+ less LESS rep than them, they'll gain 0 rep</p>
    <p>-If a guild beats a guild with 1000-2000 MORE rep than them, they'll gain 70 rep</p>
    <p>-If a guild beats a guild with 2000-3000 MORE rep than them, they'll gain 90</p>
    <p>AND SO ON...</p>
    <p>And for the bonuses AFTER the wars.... It is the # of people you killed - the # of people they killed divided by 10. So if i killed 60 of their people and won and they only killed 30 of my people i would get bonus 3 rep. And if i killed 10 of their people and won but they killed 50 of my people i would get bonus -4</p>
